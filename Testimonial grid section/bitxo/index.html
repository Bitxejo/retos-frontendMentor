                <p>
                  I was an EMT for many years before I joined the boothcamp.I've been looking to make a 
                  transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here.I signed up for
                  the free intro course and found it incredibily fun! i enrolled shortly thereafter.The next 12
                  weeks was the best -and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've
                  successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.

               <h2>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h2>
               <p>Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure
                 from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
                 by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderfull things about the program. The entire
                 curriculum and staff did not disapoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait long for assistance.
                 The agile team project , in particular , was outstanding . It look my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
                 could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience.
                 It certainly helped me a land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!."

                 the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standar is above the rest. You will get personal attention you need from an incredible
